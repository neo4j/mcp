## v0.2.0 - 2025-10-06
### Minor
* Renamed "run-cypher" to "write-cypher" and added "read-cypher".
The new read-cypher enforces read-only Cypher queries and only accepts queries
that do not modify data. It explicitly disallows admin/schema commands,
write queries, and profiling queries using the PROFILE keyword.
