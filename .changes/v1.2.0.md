## v1.2.0 - 2026-01-20
### Minor
* Added bearer token support for MCP server.
Analytics events now also emitted when the server is executed in HTTP mode; previously, only STDIO mode supported Telemetry. (needs to be enabled explicitly)

### Patch
* Added support for GDS tools when HTTP mode is in use. GDS requirements are verified in lazy mode when credentials become available.
