## v0.5.0 - 2025-11-20
### Minor
* The server now performs comprehensive pre-flight checks to verify your environment, including Neo4j connection, query capabilities, APOC installation, and will gracefully start without GDS-specific tools if the GDS library is not found.
* Added unified structured logging with slog. Configurable via NEO4J_LOG_LEVEL and NEO4J_LOG_FORMAT environment variables
* Added CLI flags for configuration (--neo4j-uri, --neo4j-username, --neo4j-password, --neo4j-database, --neo4j-read-only, --neo4j-telemetry) that override environment variables. NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, and NEO4J_PASSWORD are now required environment variables (no defaults provided).
