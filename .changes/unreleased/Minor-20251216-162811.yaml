  In this release, we add the support for HTTP transport mode.
  - HTTP Server Mode: Run neo4j-mcp as an HTTP server instead of STDIO. Use `--neo4j-transport-mode` http to enable it. Configure the server address with `--neo4j-http-host 0.0.0.0 --neo4j-http-port 8080`.
  - Per-Request Authentication & CORS: Each HTTP request authenticates independently. Control which clients can connect using `--neo4j-http-allowed-origins https://client.example.com,https://app.example.com` for granular access control.
  - Secure HTTPS Connections: Enable TLS/HTTPS for production. Use `--neo4j-http-tls-enabled` true `--neo4j-http-tls-cert-file /path/to/cert --neo4j-http-tls-key-file /path/to/key` to encrypt server communications.
