Graph science and analytics functions help you with centrality, community detection, similarity, path finding, and identifying dependencies between nodes. The tool helps you understand the analytical capabilities of the system so that you can plan or compose the right graph science operations automatically.

Remember to use unique names for graph data science projections to avoid collisions and to drop them afterwards to save memory. You must always tell the user the function you will use."),
