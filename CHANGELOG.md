## v1.0.0 - 2025-11-24
### Major
* Official 1.0.0 GA release of the Neo4j MCP server.
### Minor
* The `get-schema` tool now returns a more concise, token-efficient JSON output. The `sample-size` parameter is now configured via the `NEO4J_SCHEMA_SAMPLE_SIZE` environment variable. Alternatively the argument `--neo4j-schema-sample-size` can be used.
### Patch
* Extend analytics insights with dbms.components information such as "Edition", "Neo4j version", "MCP Version", "Cypher Version"

## v0.5.0 - 2025-11-20
### Minor
* The server now performs comprehensive pre-flight checks to verify your environment, including Neo4j connection, query capabilities, APOC installation, and will gracefully start without GDS-specific tools if the GDS library is not found.
* Added unified structured logging with slog. Configurable via NEO4J_LOG_LEVEL and NEO4J_LOG_FORMAT environment variables
* Added CLI flags for configuration (--neo4j-uri, --neo4j-username, --neo4j-password, --neo4j-database, --neo4j-read-only, --neo4j-telemetry) that override environment variables. NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, and NEO4J_PASSWORD are now required environment variables (no defaults provided).

## v0.4.1 - 2025-11-18
### Patch
* Fixed the incorrect metrics used to identify when users are coming from Aura databases

## v0.4.0 - 2025-11-14
### Minor
* Added opt-out telemetry to collect anonymous usage data for product improvement.
### Patch
* Reduced the `get-schema` output footprint by removing the empty and unused `labels` JSON entry.
* Adds a help command available using -h or --help.

## v0.3.1 - 2025-10-24
### Patch
* Add NEO4J_READ_ONLY env var to enable read-only mode. When enabled, only tools annotated as read-only are registered.


## v0.3.0 - 2025-10-16
### Minor
* Introduces a new tool, `list-gds-procedures`, to list available Graph Data Science (GDS) procedures in a Neo4j database.
This enhances the user experience within Neo4j MCP for GDS tasks by enabling LLMs to discover and utilize GDS graph algorithms.


## v0.2.0 - 2025-10-06
### Minor
* Renamed "run-cypher" to "write-cypher" and added "read-cypher".
The new read-cypher enforces read-only Cypher queries and only accepts queries
that do not modify data. It explicitly disallows admin/schema commands,
write queries, and profiling queries using the PROFILE keyword.


## v0.1.3 - 2025-09-23
### Patch
* Enhanced MCP tool annotations by adding title, destructive, idempotent, and open-world hints for get-schema and run-cypher tools to improve client understanding and behavior

## v0.1.2 - 2025-09-19
### Patch
* Improve server discoverability and tool descriptions:
- Add server instructions to better describe the Neo4j MCP server capabilities
- Enhanced get-schema tool description to clarify behavior with empty databases
- Improved run-cypher tool description for better clarity
- Add specific message when get-schema is called on empty Neo4j database


## v0.1.1 - 2025-09-18
### Patch
* MCP server version is now returned when "-v" flag is passed. "neo4j-mcp -v"

## v0.1.0 - 2025-09-17
### Minor
* First pre-release of the Neo4j MCP server with two initial tools, "get-schema" for retrieving database schema information, "run-cypher" for executing Cypher.
